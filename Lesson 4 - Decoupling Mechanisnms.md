**Lesson 4 - Decoupling Mechanisms**
	
- It will help reduce dependency between services
- ELB - Elastic load balancer can be used
- Deploy multiple EC2 instances on multiple AZs
- Also helps in security purposes
- Done in Stateless manner
- Active/Passive mechanism on multi-region:
    - One setup in 1 region (primary)
    - Another in another region (secondary)
    - If one setup fails on health check, then pass traffic to another setup
- Active/Active mechanism
    - Pass traffic to region which has lower latency
- Use route 53 for DNS service
- Decoupling with ELB
    - Make application operate with asynchronus communication
    - Make more code execute on client end
    - S3 can use event notifications to send request to lamda functions
    - Horizontal scaling for concurrent requests
    - Avoid an infinite loop by uploading results to a separate S3 bucket
    - Use S3 event notifications to notify users on completion
- Decoupling with SNS, SQS, Auto scaling
    - Lambda has some limitations like time, memory etc
    - Instead of lamba, we can make client send post message through SNS service
    - Message then sent to SQS service
    - Done in EC2 context
    - Use auto scaling groups, configure it to the requirements from message from SQS
    - If requirements is less, de-scale.
