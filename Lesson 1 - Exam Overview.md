**1.3 Well-Architected Framework**

1. Reliability Principles
	- Test recovery procedures
	- Automatic recovery
	- Scale horizontally - Adding more machines to your pool of resources
	- Stop guessing capacity
	- Manage change in automation
	
2. Performance efficiency Principles
	- Democratize advanced tech: you do not need to be expert in particular technology
	- Go global in minutes
	- Use serverless architectures
	- Experiment more often
	- Mechanical sympathy: Requirements determine the technology
  
3. Security
	- Implement strong identity foundation
	- Enable traceability
	- Apply security at all layers
	- Automate security best practices
	- Protect data in transit and at rest
	- Keep people away from data
	- Prepare for security events
  
4. Cost optimization
	- Adapt a consumption model
	- Measure overall efficiency: and take actions
	- Stop spending money on data center operations
	- Analyze and attribute expenditure: monthly bill
	- Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership
  
5. Operational Excellence
	- Perform operations as code
	- Annotated documentation
	- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
	- Refine operations procedures frequently
	- Anticipate failure: Disaster recovery
	- Learn from all operational failures: Provide feedback to team
  
  
**1.4 Question domains**

1. Design resilient architectures - 30%
	- Design a multi-tier architecture solution: multiple services
	- Design highly available and/or fault tolerant
	- Design decoupling mechanisms using AWS: Not highly reliant on each other
	- Choose apt resilient storage

2. Design high performing architectures - 28%
	- Identify elastic and scalable solutions for workload
	- Select high performing and scalable storage solutions
	- Select high performance networking solutions
	- Select high performance db solutions for workload
  
3. Design Secure applications and architectures - 24%
	- Design secure access to AWS: IAM
	- Design secure application tiers
	- Select appropriate data security solution
  
4. Design cost-optimized architectures - 18%
	- Identify cost-effective storage solutions
	- Identify Compute and Database solutions
	- Identify Network architecture solutions

2 & 3 are little bit harder. So focus on these.
